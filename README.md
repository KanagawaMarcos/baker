# Baker
Baker is college project written in "C++" (Besides being C++, the professor tells students to use the language in a really weird way).
It's goal is to that rank professors based on their scientific productions using a set of scoring rules for each Qualis Code of scientific works done by professors.

### Prerequisites

You will need a G++ Compiler and MakeFile in order to run this code.

Try it to see if G++ is installed in your machine:
```
g++ --version
```

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Marcos-Costa/baker.git
```

Move to it's main folder:

```
cd baker/
```
Compile it using the **Make** command:
```
make
```

Then simple run the code using:
```
./baker
```

## Running

While runing the first thing you will look is that:

![main menu](https://github.com/Marcos-Costa/baker/blob/master/screenshots/menu1.png)

Enter 1 and than you will be asked about the rule file and the baker parameters that you want to use (the interface is in portuguese).

![menu 2](https://github.com/Marcos-Costa/baker/blob/master/screenshots/menu2.png)

The rule file follows a structure explained in the .pdf.
After those two step, you should watch the code running.

By the end of it, a file containing the result will be generated.
